# Electromechanical_converters

*Synchronous and asynchronous electromechanical converters testing*, Jan 2018 - Jun 2018.

This project has been realised in the context of the course of electomechanical converters at UCLouvain (Belgium).

__Tasks:__ Perform an entire evaluation of synchronous and asynchronous motors through various laboratories.

__Action:__

* circuit design and analysis
* electromechanical motors testing in laboratory
* data analysis and explanation.

__Results:__ 

*Laboratory 1*
